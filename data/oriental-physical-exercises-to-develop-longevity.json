It involves the insertion of thin needles into specific points on the body, known as acupoints, to help regulate the flow of energy and restore balance. Acupuncture is a holistic therapy that works to improve physical, emotional, and spiritual health.\n\nThe history of acupuncture dates back to the Shang Dynasty in China (1600-1046 BC). It was believed that the body contained an energy force called qi (pronounced “chee”). Qi flowed through the body via pathways called meridians. If the qi was blocked or out of balance, illness and pain could occur. Acupuncture was used to restore balance to the body and keep the qi flowing.\n\nAcupuncture has been used to treat a variety of conditions ranging from pain, digestive problems, and insomnia to stress, anxiety, and depression. It works by stimulating the body’s own healing response, releasing endorphins, and improving the flow of qi.\n\nThe needles used in acupuncture are very thin and are typically inserted at varying depths depending on the condition being treated. The needles can be inserted along the meridians or at specific points to stimulate the qi. They can also be manipulated or retained in place for a period of time to further stimulate the qi.\n\nThe goal of acupuncture is to restore balance and harmony in the body. It is a safe, natural, and effective way to improve physical, mental, and emotional health. In addition, it has been found to help reduce stress, improve sleep, and boost immunity."
